Code Review

- Can I explain what my code does?
- Yes. So my main task was to create a resume using all the knowledge from what we learned in module 1. My code include basic tags and attributes that i have knowledge about. For example - P tag for paragraph, H1 - H2 tags for headings, footer tag in the end to include ending message. My code works in a way so it provides clean formatted resume with dedicated sections and information in form of lists and bullet points. It starts with <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> than it have head tag which has standard settings that are must. After that body tag in which i used header tag. In that tag i used nav tag for navigation to the section of my resume like skills, education and few more. It also include SVG tag which i used to create an image with my initials. After a little introduction in header i used main tag in which all the sections and their section ids are with the relevant information.
In the very end is footer tag. That is basically all. i used Ul and Li tags to keep my information structured. 


- What was my coding process?
- Before starting the project i used my real resume and divided the sections in it on the paper like how i want to see them on screen. i also researched a bit online about html tags and their functions. My first task was to know what i want in my resume or what i do not think is necessary. After i was sure about the content i used class notes in learn to proceed. 

- What challenges did I have?
- I was not sure about adding SVG image at first because they are very complicated and include a lot of maths and equations. I am not very good at maths so understanding how they work was bit difficult but in my online meeting with instructor he cleared i can use SVG generator to create one. It was a relief to do so. I think over time i will be able to create one by myself without the need of online resources.

- What would I do differently now?
- Well for most of it i think i am doing good, there is nothing big i would change. But if i had to start it over i would definitly do more reserach and use even more tags to make my resume impressive. Right now it is basic, clean and formatted. But i would definity try something different make it look catchy or more well presented.
